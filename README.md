# StravaAPIHikingChecker

I created this tool for my Hiking PE Class to easily check if everyone has completed a long enough activity between classes. It uses the Strava API and gets the total activity time since the time specified by the user.

There are also methods for adding users by simply giving the Oauth code. I would like to make a webserver that can handle the Oauth requests automatically.
